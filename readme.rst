Problem Scenarios
=================

Byron would like to reduce the time spent to cataloging his collection in order to spend more time listening and enjoying his music.


Current Alternatives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When Byron is able to carve out some time to listen to his collection, he is not always able to find the exact song or band he would like to listen to. He selects is the first song he encounters that closely matches the genre he wants. For example, if he could not find Bettye LaVette he would substitute with Billie Holiday as a quick selection although Billie Holiday was not his first choice.

Value Proposition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creating a digitized index, cataloging the location, album, song and artist, Byron could better locate and enjoy a specific music selection making better use of his limited timeframes. 

User Stories
============

As Byron the music collector, I want to easily catalog and access my vast amount of recorded music, so that I can select specific music quickly and increase my enjoyment of my hobby.
